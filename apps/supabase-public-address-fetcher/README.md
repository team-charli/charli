this worker will be used to process public addresses of Charli users other than the authenticated one.

Most probably in the case of Huddle.

Note: you will have to re-enable and alter the RLS policy for SELECT from
| User can access own data | PERMISSIVE | {public} | SELECT | ((auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'::text) = user_address) |                                               |

To update your Row-Level Security (RLS) policy to restrict read access to only specific columns (in your case, `name`, `wants_to_teach_langs`, `wants_to_learn_langs`, `default_native_language`), you need to adjust your approach slightly. PostgreSQL's RLS policies control row access but do not directly limit column access. Instead, column-level access control can be managed through views or column-level security policies. Here's how you can achieve your goal:

### Using Views for Column-level Access Control

1. **Create a View**: Create a view that selects only the columns you want to expose.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW public_user_data AS
    SELECT id, name, wants_to_teach_langs, wants_to_learn_langs, default_native_language
    FROM user_data
    WHERE ((auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'::text) = user_address);
    ```

    This view includes the filtering condition from your RLS policy, ensuring that users can only see their own data.

2. **Grant Usage**: Ensure users have the necessary permissions to access this view.

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON public_user_data TO public;
    ```

    Adjust the permission as necessary based on your application's roles and security requirements.

### Using Column-level Security (PostgreSQL 9.5+)

If you're using PostgreSQL 9.5 or newer, you can also use column-level security to restrict access to specific columns directly on the table. However, this is generally more complex and less flexible compared to using views.

1. **Enable Row-Level Security**: If not already done, enable RLS on your table.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE user_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ```

2. **Create a Policy for Row Access**: You already have this, but ensure it's correctly configured for your needs.

3. **Disable All Column Access by Default**: For the role(s) that will be accessing this table, revoke default access to the table's columns.

    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT ON user_data FROM public;
    ```

4. **Grant Access to Specific Columns**: Grant access to the specific columns you want to be accessible.

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT (name, wants_to_teach_langs, wants_to_learn_langs, default_native_language) ON user_data TO public;
    ```

### Recommendation

For your use case, creating a view (`public_user_data`) is likely the simpler and more maintainable approach. It provides clear separation between the data exposed to the application's users and the underlying table structure, making it easier to manage and adjust as your application evolves.

Remember to test your security configurations thoroughly in a development environment to ensure they meet your application's security requirements before deploying them to production.

But then I have to deal with joins and user_address currently serves as the primary key for my sole existing table

#### GPT:
Given your scenario where `user_address` serves as the primary key and the requirement to maintain simplicity while ensuring data access controls, you can still use views effectively without complicating the architecture with unnecessary joins. If the primary goal is to restrict the columns visible to the user while maintaining `user_address` as a key for row-level identification and access control, here's how you can approach it:

### Creating a Secure View

1. **Secure View Creation**: You can create a view that includes `user_address` for internal use but restricts access to it through application logic or additional database access controls. This way, you maintain the link to your primary key without exposing it directly.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW public_user_data AS
    SELECT name, wants_to_teach_langs, wants_to_learn_langs, default_native_language, user_address
    FROM user_data
    WHERE ((auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'::text) = user_address);
    ```

2. **Application Logic for Security**: In your application, ensure that any queries against `public_user_data` do not return the `user_address` to the client unless necessary and authorized. This approach allows you to use `user_address` for internal joins or logic without exposing it to end-users.

### Handling Joins Without Exposing Sensitive Data

If you need to perform joins with other tables while keeping `user_address` as your primary key:

- **Internal Joins for Backend Processing**: Perform joins in the backend queries where `user_address` is used to link data across tables. Ensure that the results sent to the client do not include `user_address` unless it's explicitly required and appropriately secured.

- **Use Role-Based Access Controls**: Utilize PostgreSQL roles to define what each role can see or do. For example, a backend service that performs joins and data processing might have different access levels compared to what a frontend client can request.

### Additional PostgreSQL Features

- **Column-Level Security**: Although managing column-level permissions can be more granular, it adds complexity. If you opt for this route, you can specify which roles can access `user_address`:

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT (name, wants_to_teach_langs, wants_to_learn_langs, default_native_language) ON user_data TO web_user;
    REVOKE SELECT ON COLUMN user_data.user_address FROM web_user;
    ```

    Replace `web_user` with the actual role used by your application.

- **Conditional Policies for RLS**: Your current RLS policy can remain as is to ensure that users can only access their own rows. If needed, additional policies can be created for more complex scenarios.

### Conclusion

By creating a view and carefully managing access to `user_address` through application logic and PostgreSQL's security features, you can maintain a simple yet secure architecture. This approach minimizes exposure of sensitive data while leveraging `user_address` for necessary backend processing. Always ensure that your security measures are tested thoroughly in a development environment before deployment.
